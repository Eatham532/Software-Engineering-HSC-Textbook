# 01.04 Project Management Models - Quiz

!!! quiz "Check your understanding"

    1. What is the main characteristic of the Waterfall model?

        - Each phase must be completed before moving to the next one { data-correct }
        - Development happens in short, iterative cycles
        - Requirements can be changed at any time during development
        - Working software is delivered every 1-4 weeks

    2. Which scenario would be BEST suited for the Waterfall methodology?

        - Building a mobile game for teenagers
        - Creating a social media app
        - Developing software for a medical device with strict regulatory requirements { data-correct }
        - Building a startup's minimum viable product

    3. What is a "sprint" in Agile methodology?

        - The final testing phase of the project
        - A meeting to plan the entire project scope
        - A short development cycle lasting 1-4 weeks { data-correct }
        - The documentation phase that happens at the end

    4. Which is an advantage of Agile over Waterfall?

        - More predictable timelines and budgets
        - Extensive documentation is produced
        - Users see working software early and frequently { data-correct }
        - Easier to manage large, complex projects

    5. Your teacher assigns a project to build a "Grade Calculator" with specific mathematical requirements that won't change. Which approach would be most appropriate?

        - Waterfall, because requirements are clearly defined and stable { data-correct }
        - Agile, because you need user feedback on the interface
        - Agile, because mathematical calculations are complex
        - Waterfall, because the project is too small for Agile

    6. Which statement about project documentation is most accurate?

        - Waterfall projects never produce documentation
        - Waterfall emphasizes comprehensive documentation, while Agile focuses on working software { data-correct }
        - Agile projects produce more documentation than Waterfall projects
        - Both methodologies require exactly the same amount of documentation

    7. A startup wants to build a new social media app and test different features with users quickly. Which methodology should they choose?

        - Waterfall, because social media is complex
        - Agile, because they need to adapt quickly based on user feedback { data-correct }
        - Waterfall, because they need extensive planning
        - Neither - they should use a completely different approach

    8. What is a key disadvantage of the Waterfall model?

        - Too much collaboration with users
        - Projects finish too quickly
        - Problems are discovered late in the development cycle { data-correct }
        - Too much flexibility in requirements
