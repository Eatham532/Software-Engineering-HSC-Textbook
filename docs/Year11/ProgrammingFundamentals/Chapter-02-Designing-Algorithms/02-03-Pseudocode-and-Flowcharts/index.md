# Pseudocode and Flowcharts

!!! abstract "Learning Objectives"
    By the end of this section, you will be able to:

    - Write clear, readable pseudocode using standard patterns
    - Create flowcharts
    - Convert between algorithms, pseudocode, and flowcharts
    - Use proper conventions for documenting algorithm logic
    - Represent complex control structures visually

## Introduction

Once you've analyzed an algorithm's inputs, outputs, and purpose, you need to express the logic clearly. Two main tools help communicate algorithms effectively:

- **Pseudocode**: Structured English that describes steps without language-specific syntax

- **Flowcharts**: Visual diagrams that show the flow of logic through shapes and arrows

Both methods bridge the gap between human thinking and computer code.

## Pseudocode Patterns

**Pseudocode** uses everyday language with programming structure to describe algorithms clearly. It follows consistent patterns that anyone can read, regardless of their programming language experience.

### Basic Structure

```
ALGORITHM AlgorithmName
BEGIN
    // Algorithm steps go here
END

```

### Sequence Pattern

For steps that happen one after another:

```
ALGORITHM MakeTea
BEGIN
    Boil water
    Add tea bag to cup
    Pour hot water into cup
    Wait 3 minutes
    Remove tea bag
    Add milk if desired
END

```

### Input/Output Patterns

```
INPUT variableName
OUTPUT message
OUTPUT variableName
OUTPUT "literal text"

```

**Example:**

```
ALGORITHM GreetUser
BEGIN
    OUTPUT "What is your name?"
    INPUT userName
    OUTPUT "Hello, " + userName + "!"
END

```

### Variable Assignment Pattern

```
SET variableName = expression

```

**Examples:**

```
SET total = price + tax
SET average = (num1 + num2 + num3) / 3
SET isValid = (age >= 18) AND (hasLicense = true)

```

### Selection Patterns

/// details | Simple IF
    type: note
    open: false

```
IF condition THEN
    statements
END IF

```

///

/// details | IF-ELSE
    type: note
    open: false

```
IF condition THEN
    statements for true
ELSE
    statements for false
END IF

```

///

/// details | IF-ELSE IF-ELSE
    type: note
    open: false

```
IF condition1 THEN
    statements for condition1
ELSE IF condition2 THEN
    statements for condition2
ELSE
    statements for all other cases
END IF

```

**Example: Grade Calculator**

```
ALGORITHM DetermineGrade
BEGIN
    INPUT score
    
    IF score >= 90 THEN
        SET grade = "A"
    ELSE IF score >= 80 THEN
        SET grade = "B"
    ELSE IF score >= 70 THEN
        SET grade = "C"
    ELSE IF score >= 60 THEN
        SET grade = "D"
    ELSE
        SET grade = "F"
    END IF
    
    OUTPUT "Your grade is: " + grade
END

```

///

### Iteration Patterns

/// details | WHILE Loop
    type: note
    open: false

```
WHILE condition DO
    statements
END WHILE

```

///

/// details | FOR Loop
    type: note
    open: false

```
FOR variable = start TO end DO
    statements
END FOR

```

///

/// details | FOR EACH Loop
    type: note
    open: false

```
FOR EACH item IN collection DO
    statements
END FOR

```

**Example: Find Maximum**

```
ALGORITHM FindMaximum
BEGIN
    INPUT numbers (list)
    SET maximum = first number in list
    
    FOR EACH number IN numbers DO
        IF number > maximum THEN
            SET maximum = number
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    OUTPUT "The maximum is: " + maximum
END

```

///

## Flowcharts

Flowcharts translate algorithm steps into diagrams that show the order of actions, decision points, and possible paths. They give teams a shared visual language before code is written.

### Why Flowcharts Matter

- Highlight the sequence of work, including where an algorithm branches or repeats

- Provide a quick checkpoint for peers or stakeholders who prefer visuals over code

- Reveal missing cases (for example, the "no" path on a decision) before coding begins

- Support testing and debugging because each arrow represents a path that must be validated

### Core Symbols in Context

```kroki-mermaid
flowchart LR
   Start([Start/End]):::terminator --> Input[/Input or Output/]:::io
   Input --> Process[Process]:::process
   Process --> Decision{Decision}:::decision
   Decision -->|Yes| Connector((Connector)):::connector
   Decision -->|No| End([End]):::terminator
   Connector --> End

```

- **Terminator (rounded rectangle)** marks the start or end of a flow.

- **Parallelogram** handles input or output.

- **Rectangle** holds a processing step.

- **Diamond** asks a question that splits the flow.

- **Connector** reunites a branch or links to another page.

### Following a Simple Flow

The example below shows the straight-line logic for logging into a system. Each arrow represents what happens next.

```kroki-mermaid
flowchart TD
   Start([Start]):::terminator --> Prompt[/Ask for username/]
   Prompt --> PromptPw[/Ask for password/]
   PromptPw --> Validate[Check details against database]
   Validate --> Success([Login success])

```

### Handling Decisions

Decisions turn a single path into multiple outcomes. Use meaningful labels for each branch so the reader knows what the answer means.

```kroki-plantuml
@startuml
start
:Enter age;
if (age >= 18?) then (yes)
  :Output "Adult ticket";
else (no)
  :Output "Student ticket";
endif
stop
@enduml

```

This flow makes it clear that the system always produces exactly one message, even though different rules apply.

### Representing Loops

Loops show repeated work and must always include an exit condition. The loop below keeps asking for guesses until the answer is correct or attempts run out.

```kroki-mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Start]):::terminator --> Init[Set attempts = 0]
    Init --> Limit[Set maxAttempts = 3]
    Limit --> Guess[/Ask for guess/]
    Guess --> Check{Is guess correct?}:::decision
    Check -->|Yes| Celebrate(["Display 'Correct!'"]):::terminator
    Check -->|No| Update[attempts = attempts + 1]
    Update --> TryAgain{attempts < maxAttempts?}
    TryAgain -->|Yes| Guess
    TryAgain -->|No| End([Reveal answer]):::terminator

```

### Flowchart Tips

- Make every decision branch lead to a follow-up step; never leave an arrow dangling.

- Keep text short inside each shapeâ€”use verbs for actions and questions for decisions.

- Check that every terminator is reachable; otherwise, you have a logical dead end.

- Use connectors or sub-flowcharts when the diagram no longer fits comfortably on the page.

- Align flowchart shapes with your pseudocode: each IF, loop, or assignment should appear in both representations.

## Complete Example: Password Strength Checker

Let's see the same algorithm expressed in both pseudocode and flowchart form:

### Pseudocode Version

```
ALGORITHM CheckPasswordStrength
BEGIN
    OUTPUT "Enter your password:"
    INPUT password
    
    SET length = length of password
    SET hasUpper = false
    SET hasLower = false
    SET hasDigit = false
    SET hasSpecial = false
    
    FOR EACH character IN password DO
        IF character is uppercase letter THEN
            SET hasUpper = true
        END IF
        IF character is lowercase letter THEN
            SET hasLower = true
        END IF
        IF character is digit THEN
            SET hasDigit = true
        END IF
        IF character is special symbol THEN
            SET hasSpecial = true
        END IF
    END FOR
    
    SET strengthCount = 0
    
    IF length >= 8 THEN
        SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1
    END IF
    
    IF hasUpper = true THEN
        SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1
    END IF
    
    IF hasLower = true THEN
        SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1
    END IF
    
    IF hasDigit = true THEN
        SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1
    END IF
    
    IF hasSpecial = true THEN
        SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1
    END IF
    
    IF strengthCount >= 4 THEN
        OUTPUT "Strong password"
    ELSE IF strengthCount >= 2 THEN
        OUTPUT "Medium password"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "Weak password"
    END IF
END

```

### Flowchart Version

```kroki-plantuml
@startuml
start
:OUTPUT "Enter your password:";
:INPUT password;
:SET length = length of password;
:SET hasUpper = false;
:SET hasLower = false;
:SET hasDigit = false;
:SET hasSpecial = false;
:SET i = 0;

while (i < length of password?) is (yes)
  :character = password[i];
  if (character is uppercase?) then (yes)
    :SET hasUpper = true;
  elseif (character is lowercase?) then (yes)
    :SET hasLower = true;
  elseif (character is digit?) then (yes)
    :SET hasDigit = true;
  elseif (character is special?) then (yes)
    :SET hasSpecial = true;
  endif
  :SET i = i + 1;
endwhile (no)

:SET strengthCount = 0;

if (length >= 8?) then (yes)
  :SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1;
endif

if (hasUpper = true?) then (yes)
  :SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1;
endif

if (hasLower = true?) then (yes)
  :SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1;
endif

if (hasDigit = true?) then (yes)
  :SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1;
endif

if (hasSpecial = true?) then (yes)
  :SET strengthCount = strengthCount + 1;
endif

if (strengthCount >= 4?) then (yes)
  :OUTPUT "Strong password";
elseif (strengthCount >= 2?) then (yes)
  :OUTPUT "Medium password";
else (no)
  :OUTPUT "Weak password";
endif

## Pseudocode Style Guidelines

### 1. Use Clear, Descriptive Names

**Good:**

```
SET totalPrice = itemPrice + tax + shipping
SET isEligibleForDiscount = (age >= 65) OR (isStudent = true)

```

**Avoid:**

```
SET x = a + b + c
SET flag = (n >= 65) OR (s = true)

```

### 2. Indent Consistently

**Good:**

```
IF weather = "sunny" THEN
    IF temperature > 20 THEN
        OUTPUT "Perfect day for a picnic!"
    ELSE
        OUTPUT "Sunny but too cold"
    END IF
ELSE
    OUTPUT "Not ideal weather"
END IF

```

**Avoid:**

```
IF weather = "sunny" THEN
IF temperature > 20 THEN
OUTPUT "Perfect day for a picnic!"
ELSE
OUTPUT "Sunny but too cold"
END IF
ELSE
OUTPUT "Not ideal weather"
END IF

```

### 3. One Action Per Line

**Good:**

```
INPUT firstName
INPUT lastName
SET fullName = firstName + " " + lastName
OUTPUT fullName

```

**Avoid:**

```
INPUT firstName, INPUT lastName, SET fullName = firstName + " " + lastName, OUTPUT fullName

```

### 4. Use Comments for Complex Logic

```
// Calculate compound interest: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)
SET amount = principal * (1 + rate/compoundFrequency)^(compoundFrequency * years)

```

## Converting Between Representations

### From Natural Language to Pseudocode

**Natural Language:**
"Ask the user for three numbers. Find the largest number and display it."

**Pseudocode:**

```
ALGORITHM FindLargestOfThree
BEGIN
    OUTPUT "Enter three numbers:"
    INPUT num1
    INPUT num2
    INPUT num3
    
    SET largest = num1
    
    IF num2 > largest THEN
        SET largest = num2
    END IF
    
    IF num3 > largest THEN
        SET largest = num3
    END IF
    
    OUTPUT "The largest number is: " + largest
END

```

### From Pseudocode to Flowchart

Take the pseudocode above and convert it:

```kroki-plantuml
@startuml
start
:OUTPUT "Enter three numbers:";
:INPUT num1;
:INPUT num2;
:INPUT num3;
:SET largest = num1;
if (num2 > largest?) then (yes)
  :SET largest = num2;
endif
if (num3 > largest?) then (yes)
  :SET largest = num3;
endif
:OUTPUT "The largest number is: " + largest;
stop

## Practice Activity: Library Book System

Let's create both pseudocode and flowchart for a library book borrowing system that builds on the control structures from Section 2.1:

### Requirements

1. Ask for the user's library card number

2. Ask for the book ID they want to borrow

3. Check if the user has any overdue books

4. Check if the book is available

5. If both checks pass, allow borrowing and set due date

6. If either check fails, explain why borrowing is denied

### Your Task: Complete the Pseudocode

```
ALGORITHM LibraryBookBorrowing
BEGIN
    OUTPUT "Welcome to the Library System"
    
    // Get user information
    OUTPUT "Enter your library card number:"
    INPUT cardNumber
    
    OUTPUT "Enter the book ID you want to borrow:"
    INPUT bookID
    
    // Check user status
    // TODO: Add pseudocode to check for overdue books
    // (Hint: use a boolean variable hasOverdueBooks)
    
    // Check book availability
    // TODO: Add pseudocode to check if book is available
    // (Hint: use a boolean variable isBookAvailable)
    
    // Make borrowing decision
    // TODO: Add selection structure to handle four cases:
    // 1. Both checks pass - allow borrowing
    // 2. Has overdue books - deny with message
    // 3. Book not available - deny with message
    // 4. Both problems - deny with both messages
    
END

```

### Solution

```
ALGORITHM LibraryBookBorrowing
BEGIN
    OUTPUT "Welcome to the Library System"
    
    OUTPUT "Enter your library card number:"
    INPUT cardNumber
    
    OUTPUT "Enter the book ID you want to borrow:"
    INPUT bookID
    
    // Check user status (simplified - in real system would query database)
    OUTPUT "Do you have any overdue books? (true/false):"
    INPUT hasOverdueBooks
    
    // Check book availability (simplified - in real system would query catalog)
    OUTPUT "Is the book available? (true/false):"
    INPUT isBookAvailable
    
    // Make borrowing decision
    IF hasOverdueBooks = false AND isBookAvailable = true THEN
        OUTPUT "Book borrowed successfully!"
        OUTPUT "Due date: 2 weeks from today"
    ELSE IF hasOverdueBooks = true AND isBookAvailable = false THEN
        OUTPUT "Cannot borrow: You have overdue books AND the book is not available"
    ELSE IF hasOverdueBooks = true THEN
        OUTPUT "Cannot borrow: Please return your overdue books first"
    ELSE IF isBookAvailable = false THEN
        OUTPUT "Cannot borrow: Book is currently checked out"
    END IF
END

```

### Flowchart Version

```kroki-plantuml
@startuml
start
:OUTPUT "Welcome to the Library System";
:OUTPUT "Enter your library card number:";
:INPUT cardNumber;
:OUTPUT "Enter the book ID you want to borrow:";
:INPUT bookID;
:OUTPUT "Do you have any overdue books? (true/false):";
:INPUT hasOverdueBooks;
:OUTPUT "Is the book available? (true/false):";
:INPUT isBookAvailable;

if (hasOverdueBooks = false AND isBookAvailable = true?) then (yes)
  :OUTPUT "Book borrowed successfully!";
  :OUTPUT "Due date: 2 weeks from today";
elseif (hasOverdueBooks = true AND isBookAvailable = false?) then (yes)
  :OUTPUT "Cannot borrow: You have overdue books AND the book is not available";
elseif (hasOverdueBooks = true?) then (yes)
  :OUTPUT "Cannot borrow: Please return your overdue books first";
else (no)
  :OUTPUT "Cannot borrow: Book is currently checked out";
endif

stop
@enduml

## When to Use Each Representation

### Use Pseudocode When

- Planning algorithm logic before coding

- Communicating with non-programmers

- Documenting algorithm steps clearly

- Working through complex logic problems

- Teaching algorithmic thinking

### Use Flowcharts When

- Visualizing decision paths

- Showing complex branching logic

- Training or presenting to visual learners

- Debugging logic flow problems

- Documenting system processes

### Use Both When

- Complex algorithms need multiple perspectives

- Teaching algorithm design

- Formal documentation requirements

- Peer review and collaboration

## Summary

**Pseudocode provides structured English for describing algorithms:**

**Key Patterns:**

- Sequence: steps in order

- Selection: IF-THEN-ELSE structures

- Iteration: WHILE and FOR loops

- Clear variable names and consistent indentation

**Flowcharts visualize algorithm flow using standard shapes:**

**Both methods help bridge the gap between human thinking and computer code, making algorithms easier to understand, verify, and implement.**
