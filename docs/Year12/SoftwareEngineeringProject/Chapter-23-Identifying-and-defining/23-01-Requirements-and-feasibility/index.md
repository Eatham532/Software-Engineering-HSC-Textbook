## Understanding requirements analysis

Requirements analysis is the foundation of successful software engineering projects. It involves systematically identifying what stakeholders need from a software solution and determining whether those needs can realistically be met within available constraints.

**Key principles of requirements analysis:**

- **Stakeholder-centered approach**: Understanding who will use, benefit from, or be affected by the solution

- **Evidence-based decisions**: Using research and data to validate assumptions about needs

- **Constraint awareness**: Recognising limitations in time, budget, skills, and technology

- **Clear documentation**: Recording requirements in specific, measurable, achievable terms

### Stakeholder identification and needs analysis

Effective requirements analysis begins with identifying all stakeholders and understanding their specific needs, goals, and constraints.

**Primary stakeholder categories:**

1. **End users**: People who will directly interact with the software

2. **Business stakeholders**: Decision-makers, product owners, and budget holders

3. **Technical stakeholders**: Developers, system administrators, and maintainers

4. **Regulatory stakeholders**: Compliance officers, legal teams, and auditors

**Methods for gathering stakeholder needs:**

### Market and user research methods

Validating stakeholder needs requires systematic research to understand the broader context and confirm that proposed solutions address real problems.

**Research approaches:**

1. **User surveys and questionnaires**: Quantitative data on user preferences and pain points

2. **Market analysis**: Understanding existing solutions, competition, and market gaps  

3. **User observation**: Watching how people currently perform tasks and identify inefficiencies

4. **Competitive analysis**: Evaluating what similar solutions exist and their strengths/weaknesses

## Feasibility assessment

Feasibility assessment determines whether identified requirements can realistically be implemented within project constraints. This involves evaluating technical, financial, and scheduling factors.

### Financial feasibility analysis

Financial feasibility examines whether the project can be completed within budget constraints and whether the expected benefits justify the investment.

**Key financial considerations:**

- **Development costs**: Personnel, tools, infrastructure, and third-party services

- **Operational costs**: Hosting, maintenance, support, and licensing fees

- **Opportunity costs**: What alternatives are foregone by pursuing this project

- **Return on investment**: Expected benefits compared to total investment

### Scheduling feasibility

Scheduling feasibility evaluates whether the project can be completed within required timeframes given available resources and dependencies.

**Key scheduling considerations:**

- **Resource availability**: When team members and tools will be available

- **Task dependencies**: What work must be completed before other work can begin

- **Risk buffers**: Time allocated for handling unexpected delays or complications

- **Milestone alignment**: Ensuring delivery dates align with stakeholder expectations

---

## Functional and non-functional requirements

Requirements fall into two main categories that serve different purposes but are equally important for project success.

### Functional requirements

Functional requirements describe what the system must do - the specific behaviours, features, and capabilities that stakeholders need.

**Characteristics of good functional requirements:**

- **Specific**: Clearly defined behaviour with no ambiguity

- **Measurable**: Can be verified through testing or demonstration

- **Achievable**: Technically possible within project constraints

- **Relevant**: Directly supports stakeholder needs

- **Time-bound**: Clear expectations for when functionality will be available

**Examples of functional requirements:**

### Non-functional requirements

Non-functional requirements specify how the system should perform - the quality attributes and constraints that affect user experience and system operation.

**Common categories of non-functional requirements:**

1. **Performance**: Response times, throughput, and resource usage

2. **Reliability**: System availability and error recovery capabilities  

3. **Security**: Data protection and access control measures

4. **Usability**: User interface design and accessibility standards

5. **Scalability**: Ability to handle increased load and user growth

6. **Maintainability**: Ease of updates, bug fixes, and system changes

## Data structures and data types

Defining appropriate data structures and types is essential for implementing requirements effectively and ensuring system performance and maintainability.

### Data structure selection principles

Choosing the right data structures requires understanding the operations your system will perform and the performance characteristics of different data structures.

**Key considerations:**

- **Access patterns**: How data will be read, written, and updated

- **Volume**: Expected size of datasets and growth over time

- **Performance requirements**: Speed vs. memory usage trade-offs

- **Relationships**: How different pieces of data connect to each other

## Scope definition and boundaries

Clear scope definition prevents project scope creep and ensures all stakeholders have aligned expectations about what will and will not be included in the solution.

### Defining project boundaries

Project boundaries specify what is included in the current project and what is explicitly excluded or deferred to future phases.

**Boundary categories:**

1. **Functional boundaries**: Which features and capabilities are included

2. **System boundaries**: Which systems and integrations are in scope

3. **User boundaries**: Which user groups and use cases are supported

4. **Data boundaries**: Which data sources and types are included

5. **Platform boundaries**: Which devices, browsers, or operating systems are supported

## Practice tasks

### Task 1: Stakeholder analysis exercise

Choose a software project idea relevant to your school or community (e.g., library management system, sports club management, tutoring platform). Complete a stakeholder analysis:

1. **Identify stakeholders**: List at least 6 different stakeholder groups who would be affected by or interested in your project

2. **Assess influence and interest**: Create a stakeholder priority matrix categorizing each group

3. **Conduct mock interviews**: Write 5 interview questions and provide realistic responses for your highest priority stakeholder group

4. **Document needs**: Use the `StakeholderAnalysis` class to record and organize stakeholder requirements

**Expected outcome**: A structured stakeholder analysis with clear requirements traceability.

### Task 2: Financial feasibility assessment

Using the same project idea from Task 1, perform a comprehensive financial feasibility analysis:

1. **Estimate development costs**: Include personnel, tools, infrastructure, and any third-party services

2. **Project operational costs**: Calculate ongoing hosting, maintenance, and support costs

3. **Quantify benefits**: Identify specific financial benefits (cost savings, efficiency gains, revenue increases)

4. **Calculate ROI**: Use the `FinancialFeasibilityAnalysis` class to determine project viability

5. **Risk assessment**: Identify financial risks and how they might impact the analysis

**Expected outcome**: A complete financial feasibility report with ROI calculation and risk assessment.

### Task 3: Requirements specification

For your chosen project, create detailed functional and non-functional requirements:

1. **Functional requirements**: Document at least 5 functional requirements with clear acceptance criteria and test scenarios

2. **Non-functional requirements**: Specify measurable performance, security, and usability requirements

3. **Data model**: Define the main entities, their attributes, and relationships using the data structure analysis framework

4. **Scope definition**: Create a comprehensive scope document clearly defining what is in scope, out of scope, and planned for future phases

**Expected outcome**: A complete requirements specification document ready for development planning.

## Key takeaways

This section introduced systematic approaches to requirements analysis and feasibility assessment:

**Requirements Analysis Process:**

- **Stakeholder-centered approach**: Understanding who will be affected by and benefit from the solution

- **Evidence-based validation**: Using research and data to confirm assumptions about needs and problems

- **Structured documentation**: Recording requirements in specific, measurable, achievable terms

- **Traceability**: Linking requirements back to stakeholder needs and forward to design decisions

**Feasibility Assessment Framework:**

- **Financial viability**: Comprehensive cost-benefit analysis with ROI calculations

- **Scheduling realism**: Honest assessment of timeline constraints and resource availability  

- **Technical feasibility**: Evaluation of whether required capabilities can be implemented

- **Risk awareness**: Identifying and planning for potential obstacles and complications

**Requirements Classification:**

- **Functional requirements**: What the system must do, with clear acceptance criteria and test scenarios

- **Non-functional requirements**: How the system should perform, with measurable quality attributes

- **Data requirements**: Appropriate structures and types based on usage patterns and volume

- **Scope boundaries**: Clear definition of what is included, excluded, and planned for future phases

**Next Steps**: In Section 23.2, we'll explore ideation and modeling tools that help transform these requirements into concrete solution designs and implementation plans.
